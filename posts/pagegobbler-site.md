The Page Gobbler marketing site is a simple Node.js app using my favorite framework, [Express](http://expressjs.com/). The site's job is to quickly and simply explain the benefits of using the Page Gobbler Mac App as well as to provide a means for customers to submit questions to me. I built the contact form using a node module called Nodemailer.

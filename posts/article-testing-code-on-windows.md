title: Writing code on Mac or Linux but testing on Windows with hot-reloading
category: article
description: As a developer, I often want to test my code on Windows, but don't have a Windows box handy. This tutorial demonstrates how to use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to make provisioning Windows test instances easier. In this post, I also provide a working Packer template and Terraform configuration to deploy your own Windows test instance, as well as instructions for mounting a local folder over RDP.
